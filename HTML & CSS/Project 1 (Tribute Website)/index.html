                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam BR </b> (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July 2015) was an Indian
                    aerospace scientist and statesman who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007.
                    He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering.
                    He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                    Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
                    was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development
                    efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development
                    of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal
                    organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
                    first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.[5]
